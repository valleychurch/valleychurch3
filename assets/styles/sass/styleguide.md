# Dev guidelines
This documentation is meant to serve as a guide for how to develop well for the <a href="http://valleychurch.eu">valleychurch.eu</a> WordPress theme and other web properties.

The theme is built using Sass (SCSS syntax) and Javascript, compiled with Grunt. Instructions on how to set up a local development environment are included below to get you up and running quickly.

Development structure mostly follows guidance set out by <a href="http://codeguide.co/" target="_blank">@mdo's Code Guide</a> and <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/dafed/managing-css-projects-with-itcss" target="_blank">Harry Roberts' ITCSS</a> so please read them both!
